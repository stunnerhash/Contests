			       LESSON 4 SUMMARY


  1. Ctrl-g  displays your location in the file and the file status.
     Shift-G  moves to the end of the file.  A line number followed
     by  Shift-G  moves to that line number.

  2. Typing  /	followed by a phrase searches FORWARD for the phrase.
     Typing  ?	followed by a phrase searches BACKWARD for the phrase.
     After a search type  n  to find the next occurrence in the same direction
     or  Shift-N  to search in the opposite direction.

  3. Typing  %	while the cursor is on a  (,),[,],{, or }  locates its
     matching pair.

  4. To substitute neww for the first neww on a line type    :s/neww/neww
     To substitute neww for all 'neww's on a line type	   :s/neww/neww/g
     To substitute phrases between two line #'s type	   :#,#s/neww/neww/g
     To substitute all occurrences in the file type	   :%s/neww/neww/g
     To ask for confirmation each time add 'c'		   :%s/neww/neww/gc

		Lesson 5.1: HOW TO EXECUTE AN EXTERNAL COMMAND


   ** Type  :!	followed by an external command to execute that command. **

  1. Type the familiar command	:  to set the cursor at the bottom of the
     screen.  This allows you to enter a command.

  2. Now type the  !  (exclamation point) character.  This allows you to
     execute any external shell command.

  3. As an example type   ls   following the ! and then hit <ENTER>.  This
     will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were at the
     shell prompt.  Or use   :!dir  if ls doesn't work.

---> Note:  It is possible to execute any external command this way.

---> Note:  All  :  commands must be finished by hitting <ENTER>




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		      Lesson 5.2: MORE ON WRITING FILES


     ** To save the changes made to the file, type  :w FILENAME. **

  1. Type  :!dir  or  :!ls  to get a listing of your directory.
     You already know you must hit <ENTER> after this.

  2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.

  3. Now type:	 :w TEST   (where TEST is the filename you chose.)

  4. This saves the whole file	(Vim Tutor)  under the name TEST.
     To verify this, type    :!dir   again to see your directory

---> Note that if you were to exit Vim and enter again with the filename TEST,
     the file would be an exact copy of the tutor when you saved it.

  5. Now remove the file by typing (MS-DOS):    :!del TEST



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		    Lesson 5.3: A SELECTIVE WRITE COMMAND


	** To save part of the file, type   :#,# w FILENAME **

  1. Once again, type  :!dir  or  :!ls  to obtain a listing of your directory
     and choose a suitable filename such as TEST.

  2. Move the cursor to the top of this page and type  Ctrl-g  to find the
     number of that line.  REMEMBER THIS NUMBER!

  3. Now move to the bottom of the page and type  Ctrl-g again.  REMEMBER THIS
     LINE NUMBER ALSO!

  4. To save ONLY a section to a file, type   :#,# w TEST   where #,# are
     the two numbers you remembered (top,bottom) and TEST is your filename.

  5. Again, see that the file is there with  :!dir  but DO NOT remove it.




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		   Lesson 5.4: RETRIEVING AND MERGING FILES


       ** To insert the contents of a file, type   :r FILENAME **

  1. Type   :!dir   to make sure your TEST filename is present from before.

  2. Place the cursor at the top of this page.

NOTE:  After executing Step 3 you will see Lesson 5.3.	Then move DOWN to
       this lesson again.

  3. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command   :r TEST   where TEST is
     the name of the file.

NOTE:  The file you retrieve is placed starting where the cursor is located.

  4. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there
     are now two copies of Lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       LESSON 5 SUMMARY


  1.  :!command  executes an external command.

      Some useful examples are (MS-DOS):
	  :!dir			-  shows a directory listing.
	  :!del FILENAME	-  removes file FILENAME.

  2.  :w FILENAME  writes the current Vim file to disk with name FILENAME.

  3.  :#,#w FILENAME  saves the lines # through # in file FILENAME.

  4.  :r FILENAME  retrieves disk file FILENAME and inserts it into the
      current file following the cursor position.







~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			    Lesson 6.4: SET OPTION


	  ** Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case **


  1. Search for 'ignore' by entering:
     /ignore
     Repeat several times by hitting the n key

  2. Set the 'ic' (Ignore case) option by typing:
     :set ic

  3. Now search for 'ignore' again by entering: n
     Repeat search several more times by hitting the n key

  4. Set the 'hlsearch' and 'incsearch' options:
     :set hls is

  5. Now enter the search command again, and see what happens:
     /ignore

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       LESSON 6 SUMMARY

  3. Typing a capital  R  enters Replace mode until  <ESC>  is pressed to exit.

  4. Typing ":set xxx" sets the option "xxx"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		       LESSON 7: ON-LINE HELP COMMANDS


		      ** Use the on-line help system **

  Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, try one of
  these three:
	- press the <HELP> key (if you have one)
	- press the <F1> key (if you have one)
	- type   :help <ENTER>

  Type   :q <ENTER>   to close the help window.

  You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the
  ":help" command.  Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):

	:help w
	:help c_<T
	:help insert-index
	:help user-manual


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		       LESSON 8: CREATE A STARTUP SCRIPT

			  ** Switch on Vim features **

  Vim has many more features than Vi, but most of them are disabled by default.
  To start using more features you have to create a "vimrc" file.

  1. Start editing the "vimrc" file, this depends on your system:
	:edit ~/.vimrc			for Unix
	:edit $VIM/_vimrc		for MS-Windows


  2. Now read the example "vimrc" file text:
	:read $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim

  3. Write the file with:

	:write

  The next time you start Vim it will use syntax highlighting.
  You can add all your preferred settings to this "vimrc" file.
